sudo apt update

# To upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions run:

# if that is needed to upgrade the whole system.
sudo apt full-upgrade

sudo apt install package_name
sudo apt install package1 package2

# Removing Packages (apt remove)
sudo apt remove package_name

# If you want to remove the package including all configuration files, use purge instead of remove:
sudo apt purge package_name

# Remove Unused Packages (apt autoremove)
# Whenever a new package that depends on other packages is installed on the system,
# the package dependencies will be installed too. When the package is removed,
# the dependencies will stay on the system. This leftover packages are no longer
# used by anything else and can be removed.
# To remove the unneeded dependencies use the following command:
sudo apt autoremove

# Listing Packages (apt list)
# To list all available packages use the following command:
sudo apt list
sudo apt list | grep package_name
sudo apt list --upgradeable
sudo apt list --installed
sudo dpkg-query -l

# Searching Packages (apt search)
# This command allows you to search for a given package in the list of the available packages:
sudo apt search package_name
# If found, the command will return the packages which name matches the search term.

# Package Information (apt show)
# The information about the package dependencies, installation size, the package source,
# and so on might be useful before removing or installing a new package.
sudo apt show package_name
