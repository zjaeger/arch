Modifying control files

  ALTER DATABASE BACKUP CONTROLFILE TO TRACE ;
  ALTER DATABASE BACKUP CONTROLFILE TO '$ORACLE_HOME/tmp/ct.sql' ;

  editing ... change any MAX.. parameter (primary purpose)

How Oracle uses control files
  
  if RMAN (Recovery Manager) facility IS ENABLED then
    control files grows (backup history - also in Recovery Catalog)
  end if

CREATE SCHEMA
  creating all user objects in single statement (it allows only three
  operations: CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW, GRANT)

Using Views for security
  CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW emp_sal AS
  SELECT ...
  ... WHERE login_name = USER ...
  WITH CHECK OPTION ;

Stored programs
  packages: overloading (one program name can be used more than once
  as long as the formal argument parameter list is different)
  PL/SQL Wrapper: wrapNN iname=readable_fname [oname=encrypted_fname]
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('e_no is '||e_no); -- automatic "TO_CHAR"
  rdbms/admin/DBMS_<name>.sql ... for example: DBMS_UTIL.sql

Synonyms (public, private)
  if an underlying object is deleted from the database, the synonym
  that was created for it will not be deleted automatically.

Privileges
  CREATE SESSION (without this - nothing is possible), user with this
  can access own objects and public objects
  PUBLIC user - special entry in the data dictionary
  System Privileges: complete list: SYSTEM_PRIVILEGE_MAP
  Object Prilileges: complete list: TABLE_PRIVILEGE_MAP
    ALTER, AUDIT, COMMENT, DELETE, GRANT, INDEX, INSERT, LOCK,
    RENAME, SELECT, UPDATE, REFERENCES, EXECUTE, CREATE, READ, WRITE
  (GRANT all TO ... ; --- means all above privileges)
  (INDEX: allows the user to create indexes on a specific table owned
   by another user)

Roles (named collection of privileges)
  if the role's privileges are changed -> will be in effect on next
  logon
  Determining Privileges Granted to a User:
    SELECT * FROM dba_role_privs WHERE grantee = 'MARY' ;
  Determining Privileges Granted to a Role:
    SELECT * FROM dba_sys_privs WHERE grantee = 'CONNECT' ;
  Oracle-Supplied Roles
    CONNECT
    RESOURCE (adds cluster, procedure and trigger privs.)
    DBA
    SYSOPER (abilily to startup and shut down the database)
    SYSDBA (DBA+ability to create, start up, shut down and recover DB)
  For application users: standard logon role, should have only the
  CREATE SESSION sys.priv.

Profiles
  product profiles
  system resource profiles
  (Oracle6: PRODUCT_USER_PROFILE,
  Oracle7: PRODUCT_PROFILE, USER_PROFILE)

Data Dictionary
  CATALOG.SQL ... data dict. views (USER_%, ...)
  SQL.BSQ ... source code for the data dictionary (owned by SYS),
  called once on "CREATE DATABASE"
  tab$, fet$ (free extent table), uet$ (used extent table),
  user$ (USERS and ROLES)
  Check DB objects after "CREATE DATABASE ..."
    SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM obj$ GROUP BY type ;
  obj$.type { 0..6 } -> { reference rec. for next object number,
    indexes, tables, clusters, synonyms, sequences }
  DBA_PROFILES
    profile, resource_name, limit, resource_type {KERNEL, PASSWORD}
